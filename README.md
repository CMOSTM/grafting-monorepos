# Universe workshop: Grafting monorepos
Keep monorepos manageable using grafting


## Exercise 2

We will use different analysis tools to identify wrong practices in a repository. To do it we will use the following commands:
- **git-sizer**
- **git-find-dirs-many-files**
- **git-find-lfs-extensions**
- **git-find-dirs-unwanted**
- **filter-repo**

Before starting any analysis, **pick one repository of your preference** that you would like to analyze. Make sure during all this exercise you don't post any private information that should not be shared publicly.

Clone this repository as we have added all the tools into the repository for making the workshop convinient:
```
git clone git@github.com:githubuniverseworkshops/grafting-monorepos.git

or

gh repo clone githubuniverseworkshops/grafting-monorepos
```

### Stats of repo size: [`git-sizer`](https://github.com/github/git-sizer)

TBD

```
```

### Print directories with the number of files contained: [`git-find-dirs-many-files`](https://github.com/githubuniverseworkshops/grafting-monorepos/blob/main/scripts/git-find-dirs-many-files)

TBD

```
```

### Find files that should be in LFS: [`git-find-lfs-extensions`](https://github.com/githubuniverseworkshops/grafting-monorepos/blob/main/scripts/git-find-lfs-extensions)

TBD

```
```

### Find dirs that should not be commited: [`git-find-dirs-unwanted`](https://github.com/githubuniverseworkshops/grafting-monorepos/blob/main/scripts/git-find-dirs-unwanted)

TBD

```
```

### Analyze the repository: `git filter-repo --analyze`

TBD

```
```
